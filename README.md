# MongoDB-CRUD-Operations-with-Python-GUI (Movies Database) ðŸŽ¬

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. The application should allow users to manage **movie records** in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a modern desktop application that enables seamless interaction with a MongoDB database. This will help users to efficiently insert, retrieve, update, and delete movie records while maintaining a clean and modern user interface.

## ðŸ’» Software and Hardware Requirements

| **Software Requirements** | **Hardware Requirements**      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Python 3.x                | Laptop/PC with minimum 4GB RAM |
| CustomTkinter             | Dual-core processor            |
| PyMongo                   | 500MB free disk space          |
| MongoDB (Community)       |                                |

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **Python** â€“ Programming language for application logic  
* **CustomTkinter** â€“ Modern GUI framework for Python  
* **PyMongo** â€“ MongoDB driver for Python  
* **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for storing movie data

## âœ¨ Features

* Add new movie records (Title, Genre, Year)  
* View all records in a modern table view  
* Update existing movie details  
* Delete records easily  
* Responsive and modern UI with light/dark mode support  

---

## ðŸ“œ Output Explanation

The application provides a form to enter **Title**, **Genre**, and **Year**.  
Users can:

* Insert new movie records  
* View them in a structured table format  
* Update existing entries by selecting them  
* Delete records with one click  

The **Treeview widget** is used for displaying data in a tabular format. Selecting a row automatically loads the record into the input fields for editing. **CustomTkinter** ensures the GUI looks modern and user-friendly.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the integration of MongoDB with a Python GUI application for managing **movie data**. With **CustomTkinter**, the interface is visually appealing and easy to use. CRUD operations are implemented efficiently, making the application suitable for small-scale database management tasks such as personal movie collections or learning database concepts.
